A very cool program that arranges your desktop icons in various shapes. I don't have a
full dictionary but the best option is to run it with 18 icons, which will result in a working
analog clock.
I really need to change it to port it to windows 7, since it seems the API I used 
doesn't work anymore.

Note - currently only works on Windows XP. Also you'll probably need a mssvc redistributable.
